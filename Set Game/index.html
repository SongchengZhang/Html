                Set (stylized as SET) is a real-time card game. 
                The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across 
                three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes 
                (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), 
                shading (solid, striped, or open), and color 
                (red, green, or purple). Each possible combination of features 
                (e.g. a card with three striped green diamonds) appears as a card 
                precisely once in the deck.

                In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a set. 
                For each one of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, 
                and shading — the three cards must display that feature as a) either 
                all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature 
                the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the 
                feature and the remaining card showing a different version.
